            const body = `👋 Hey there, reviewer!

              A **Terraform Plan** will need to run for this PR but it needs approval before proceeding. This is to avoid leaking secrets, and we need you to look for the following before approving:
                1. 🔍 **No workflow YAML files** (`.github/workflows/*.yml`) have been changed.
                2. 🗂️ Only **repository configuration files** have been **added or modified** (no unrelated files touched).
              
              ✅ If everything looks good, approve the run by:
                - Looking for the section "This branch is waiting for a deployment approval, promote needs your review" and select "Show environments"
                - Right below, select "terraform-plan / terraform-plan <#number of deployment>"
                - In the new screen, select "Review deployments" that opens a pop-up window
                - In the new pop-up window check the checkbox "promote", add a comment if you see fit, and select "Approve and deploy"
              
              Once deployment is approved, you can go back to the PR and you will see that:
                - 📦 The **Terraform Plan** will proceed to ingest the repo configuration files.
                - 🌍 Using the **Terraform GitHub provider**, it will compare the desired state with the current state.
                - 📊 The plan should show diffs **only for the repository configurations that were added or modified** — nothing else.
                
              🚀 If that's the case, we're good to move forward and approve the PR!`;
